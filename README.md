# Calibrated Boosting-Forest

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/haozhenWu/Calibrated-Boosting-Forest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/haozhenWu/Calibrated-Boosting-Forest)

Calibrated Boosting-Forest (CBF) is an integrative technique that leverages both continuous and binary labels and output calibrated posterior probabilities. It is originally designed for ligand-based virtual screening and can be extended to
other applications.
Calibrated Boosting-Forest is a package created by Haozhen Wu from [Small Molecule Screening Facility](http://www.uwhealth.org/uw-carbone-cancer-center/for-researchers/shared-resources/smsf/small-molecule-screening/27197)  
at University of Wisconsin-Madison.

by Haozhen Wu

## Key features:  

* Take both continuous and binary labels as input (multi-labels)
* Superior ranking power over individual regression or classification model  
* Output well calibrated posterior probabilities
* Streamlined hyper-parameter tuning stage
* Support multiple evaluation and stopping metrics  
* Competitive benchmark results for well-known public datasets  
* [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) backend

## Installation

We recommend you to use Anaconda for convenient installing packages. Right now, LightChem has been tested for Python 2.7 under OS X and linux Ubuntu Server 16.04.   

1. Download 64-bit Python 2.7 version of Anaconda for linux/OS X [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and follow the instruction. After you installed Anaconda, you will have most of the dependencies ready.  

2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if do not have:  
   Linux Ubuntu:    
   ```bash
   sudo yum install git-all
   ```

3. Install `scikit-learn`:  
   ```bash
   conda install scikit-learn=0.18
   ```

4. Install conda distribution of xgboost
   ```bash
   conda install --yes -c conda-forge xgboost=0.6a2
   ```

5. Install [rdkit](http://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html)  Note: `rdkit` is only used to transform SMILE string into fingerprint.  
   ```bash
   conda install -c omnia rdkit
   ```

6. Clone the `Calibrated-Boosting-Forest` github repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/haozhenWu/Calibrated-Boosting-Forest.git
   ```
   `cd` into `Calibrated-Boosting-Forest` directory and execute  
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```


## Testing

To test that the dependencies have been installed correctly, simply enter `pytest`
in the lightchem directory.  This requires the optional `pytest` Python package.
The current tests 1.confirm that the required dependencies exist and can be
imported, 2.confirm the model performance results of one target MUV-466 fall into
expected ranges.

## FAQ  

1. When I import lightchem, the following error shows up `version GLIBCXX_3.4.20 not found`:   
   Try:  
   ```bash   
   conda install libgcc
   ```
