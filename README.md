# LightChem

LightChem provides high level machine-learning interface that served to used by  
researcher without deep machine-learning background. It aims to offer convenient    
exploration for researcher interested in machine-learning for drug discovery.  
LightChem is a package created by Haozhen Wu from [Small Molecule Screening Facility](http://www.uwhealth.org/uw-carbone-cancer-center/for-researchers/shared-resources/smsf/small-molecule-screening/27197) at University of Wisconsin-Madison.  

## Key features:  

* [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) backend  
* Supports tree based models and regression models  
* Interface to use ensemble(stacking) models  
* Support multiple evaluation metrics  
* Common featurization methods to transform molecules into fingerprint  
* Competitive benchmark results for well-known public datasets
