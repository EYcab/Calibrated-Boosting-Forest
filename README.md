# LightChem

LightChem provides high level machine-learning interface that served to used by researcher without deep machine-learning background. It aims to offer convenient exploration for researcher interested in machine-learning for drug discovery. LightChem is a package created by Haozhen Wu from [Small Molecule Screening Facility](http://www.uwhealth.org/uw-carbone-cancer-center/for-researchers/shared-resources/smsf/small-molecule-screening/27197)  
at University of Wisconsin-Madison.  

## Key features:  

* [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) backend
* Parallel computing    
* Supports tree based models and regression models  
* Interface to use ensemble(stacking) models  
* Support multiple evaluation metrics  
* Common featurization methods to transform molecules into fingerprint  
* Competitive benchmark results for well-known public datasets  

## Dependencies:

* [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)  version = 0.18.1

## Installation

We recommend you to use Anaconda for convenient installing packages. Right now, LightChem has been tested for Python 2.7 under OS X and linux Ubuntu Server 16.04.   

1. Download 64-bit Python 2.7 version of Anaconda for linux/OS X [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and follow the instruction. After you installed Anaconda, you will have most of the dependencies ready.  

2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if do not have:  
   Linux Ubuntu:    
   ```bash
   sudo yum install git-all
   ```

3. Install `sklearn`:  
   ```bash
   conda install scikit-learn=0.18
   ```

4. Install `xgboost` [documentation](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html)  
   Linux Ubuntu:  Build xgboost shared library  
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost
   cd xgboost; make -j4
   ```
   Or if OSX: Build xgboost shared library  
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost
   cd xgboost; cp make/minimum.mk ./config.mk; make -j4
   ```
   After shared library is built, build xgboost python package  
   ```bash
   cd python-package; python setup.py develop --user
   ```

5. Install [rdkit](http://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html)  Note: `rdkit` is only used to transform SMILE string into fingerprint.  
   ```bash
   conda install -c omnia rdkit
   ```

6. Clone the `lightchem` github repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/haozhenWu/lightchem.git
   ```
   `cd` into `lightchem` directory and execute  
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Benchmark Results

Model Abbreviation:  
`GbtreeLogistic`: Gradient boosted tree with binary logistic as objective  
`GbtreeRegression`: Gradient boosted tree with linear regression as objective  
`GblinearLogistic`: Gradient boosted linear with binary logistic as objective    
`GblinearRegression`: Gradient boosted linear with linear regression as objective  

Evaluation results report below are mean/median of k-fold cross-validation results among all targets in a given dataset.

Concatenated Version:  
Molecules of targets from same dataset are concatenated together into a single big dataframe, which leads to many missing values in the labels. Molecules without a lab result for a given target assume having a negative label. This approach might benefit multitask learning.
