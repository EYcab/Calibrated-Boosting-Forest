This folder contains scripts of running keck_pria datasets.   
General workflow:  
1. Script keck_use_FP.py call VsEnsembleModel_keck class to test
all combinations of models. Output --> out.txt and summary.txt     
2. Choose the best model, which is layer2_GbtreeLogistic_ROCAUC in this case.

Scripts keck_dataset.py, generate_features.py use DeepChem's featurizer.   
Experimenting adding ConvGraph features. (Need DeepChem installed.)
